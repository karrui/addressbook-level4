=== Enhancement Added: Find/Findany feature with prefixes

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=find]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Previous behaviour of find operation does not allow user to search for other details except for their name.

This implementation enhances the usability of the application by allowing the user to utilizes different prefixes to search
for single/multiple contact details or a portion of details.

user under certain circumstances (e.g. At certain time or day, user might opt for brighter look and feel on the address book)
