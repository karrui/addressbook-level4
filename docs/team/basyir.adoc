=== Enhancement Added: Remove tags from the AddressBook.

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=removetag]

#End of Extract#

==== Justification

User had to delete the entry if they had keyed in a wrong tag and remade a whole other entry with the same parameters
to change the tags.

This implementation enhances the usability of the application by allowing the user to update necessary tags and
removing them when it becomes obsolete.
